RECURRENCE
Chromosome inversion recurrence summary:
  High-quality inversions with consensus labels: 93 (single-event = 61, recurrent = 32).
  Fraction recurrent = 34.41%.

DIVERSITY
Nucleotide diversity (π) comparisons:
  Loci with finite π for both orientations: 67.
  Across all loci: mean π(inverted) = 0.000273, mean π(direct) = 0.000387.
    Paired t-test for π(inverted) vs π(direct): t = -2.870, p = 5.505e-03.
  Single-event inversions: median π(inverted) = 6.000000e-06, median π(direct) = 0.000233.
  Recurrent inversions: median π(inverted) = 0.000359, median π(direct) = 0.000442.
  Within inverted haplotypes: recurrent median π = 0.000359; single-event median π = 6.000000e-06.

LINEAR MODEL
Orientation × recurrence linear model on log π ratios (Model A):
  Detection floor applied before logs: ε = 6.325000e-06.
  Single-event: Inverted vs Direct: fold-change = 0.279 (95% CI 0.151–0.515), p = 4.427e-05.
  Recurrent: Inverted vs Direct: fold-change = 1.099 (95% CI 0.905–1.336), p = 0.341.
  Interaction (difference between those two): fold-change = 3.941 (95% CI 2.072–7.497), p = 2.910e-05.
  Overall inversion effect (pooled Δ-logπ): fold-change = 0.537 (95% CI 0.372–0.776), p = 9.424e-04.

DIFFERENTIATION
Hudson's FST between orientations:
  Single-event: median FST = 0.325 (n = 28).
  Recurrent: median FST = 0.070 (n = 32).
  Mann–Whitney U test (single-event vs recurrent): U = 628.000, p = 7.680e-03.
  Highly differentiated loci: 26 with FST > 0.2; 10 with FST > 0.5.
